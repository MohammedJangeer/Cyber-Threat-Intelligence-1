            <p>Implement session locks after set periods of time for privileged accounts, upon privileged user requests, or in reaction to suspicious behavior. Only reestablish access after the user provides a matched-pair challenge response.</p>

            <p>Identify, document, and enforce security controls on which user actions may be performed on a system without passing the matched-pair challenge response—for example, contacting technical support or making emergency calls.</p>
            <p>Security Control:</p>
            <p>AC-14: Permitted Actions Without Identification or Authentication</p>

            <p>Develop matched-pair authentication processes that are resistant to replay attacks by establishing large sets of one-time challenge response authenticators.</p>

        <div class="box" id="box4">
            <p>Capture information that uniquely identifies user devices requesting authentication to gain intelligence on unidentified adversaries who fail the matched-pair challenge response.</p>

            <p>IA-3: Device Identification and Authentication - (4) Device Attestation</p>

            <p>Physically and logically segregate the matched-pair challenge response system and enforce strict access controls to safeguard it against compromise.</p>
