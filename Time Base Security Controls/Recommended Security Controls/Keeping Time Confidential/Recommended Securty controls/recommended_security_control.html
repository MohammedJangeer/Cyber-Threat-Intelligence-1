    <h1>Recommended Security Controls and Mitigations</h1>
    <div class="control">
        <h2>1. Implement protections that block access to time data in timestamp logs or other information-monitoring logs.</h2>
        <p>
            Preventing time spillage or timestamp leakage could require physical, environmental, media, and technical controls.

        <h2>2. Review your current information architecture with respect to time.</h2>
        <p>
            Including the philosophy, requirements, and tactics necessary to implement access and confidentiality controls around time data in your environment. If stakeholders agree to time restrictions, document them in a security plan with an approved budget, resources, and time dedicated to implementation.

        <h2>3. Conduct a log review and internal hunt to discover communication occurring over port 123 to any unofficial NTP servers in your environment.</h2>
        <p>
            Look for NTP communication to external NTP servers and consider blocking access to NTP servers you do not control.
