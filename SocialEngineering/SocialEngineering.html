            <h2>1. Establish Safeguards</h2>
            <p>Implement standard trust frameworks for employees to reduce the risk of compromise by social engineering. Identify high-value targets in your environment, and then establish security protocols, policies, and procedures for the appropriate control and handling of sensitive information on those systems.</p>

            <p>Develop solutions that force your employees to slow down and think in logical terms, thereby avoiding the cognitive biases and shortcuts social engineers most often exploit.</p>
