        <h2>Using Threat Modeling to Identify Potential Attack Vectors</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Model your information systems.</strong> Create an accurate DFD with the help of your organization’s network, security, development, business, and other IT system owners and experts. It does not need to use Unified Modeling Language (UML) or other advanced concepts—it simply needs to accurately represent your systems and the information within them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>STRIDE and guard.</strong> STRIDE is a threat-modelling methodology developed by Microsoft to describe what could go wrong in an information system. The acronym comes from the ways in which an attacker could violate six properties of the system:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Spoofing Identity = Authentication</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Tampering with Data = Integrity</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Repudiation/Deniability = Nonrepudiation</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Information Disclosure = Confidentiality</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Denial of Service = Availability</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Elevation of Privilege = Authorization</strong></li>
                </ul>
                To use STRIDE, review your DFD and, at every point where there is data input, data processing, data output, or other data flows/rules, hypothesize how an adversary may threaten it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Do not advertise bolted-on security.</strong> Threat modelling is an iterative process of evaluating new threats and developing protective countermeasures. Avoid defensive efforts that may backfire by drawing attention to vulnerable areas.
