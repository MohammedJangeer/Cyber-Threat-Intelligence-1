            <h2>What is Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)?</h2>
            <p>CTI is the process of gathering and analyzing information about cyber threats. It helps organizations understand the "who," "what," "where," "when," "why," and "how" of cyber attacks. This knowledge allows organizations to proactively defend their networks and data.</p>
